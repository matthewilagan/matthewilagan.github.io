                <h2>MATTHEW ILAGAN</h2>
                <p>
                    I am Matthew Ilagan but you can call me by my first name "Matthew" but some of my friends call me "Mateo", I was born and raised here in pasig, my birthday was on June 3, that's only personal details that I can give, so my hobbies are that I love taking photos, capturing some moments as you go in my portfolio you will see some of my shots and some pics of myself, 
                    back then when I was an shs student in the University of the East Manila I used to be a photographer and videographer in a club and I covered some events and meetings such as the "myx concert" and the University week or what we called "foundation week"
                    it was fun being a photographer and videographer that year. So yea I also like playing instrument such as the bass guitar, I am part of the music ministry in our church, I also play just for fun when I'm alone or with some of my friends. To be honest 
                    there's nothing to know about me I'm just a simple and humble person, so yea one advice on knowing me
                    you can have my trust and respect but don't ever break it, I am soft as mamon but can also be hard like a rock. i am friendly and approachable so if you want to talk to me don't 
                    hesitate just send me a message our just greet me in person.
